# Novel AI Architectures for Learning of Waveforms
PI: Jesse Spencer-Smith  

From studies of electroencephalograms (EEG), galaxy light waves, gravitational waves, and speech, researchers need a way to directly learn from waveform data. In this project, we will explore new approaches to encoding and representing waveform data for use by researchers.
