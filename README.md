# Novel AI Architectures for Learning of Waveforms
PI: Jesse Spencer-Smith  

From studies of electroencephalograms (EEG), galaxy light waves, gravitational waves, and speech, researchers need a way to directly learn from waveform data. In this project, we will explore new approaches to encoding and representing waveform data for use by researchers.

## Suggested Tips for Pseudocode Generation

1. Provide Examples from Formal Algorithm Papers:
   - Share relevant algorithms from "Formal Algorithms for Transformers" paper.
   - Highlight key structures and conventions used in the academic pseudocode
   - Be sure to provide it with the Appendix 

2. Use Reinforcement through Human Feedback:
   - Generate initial pseudocode using AI
   - Review and provide specific feedback on the generated code
   - Iterate with the AI, incorporating your feedback for improved results

3. Specify Desired Level of Detail:
   - Clarify whether you need high-level or low-level pseudocode
   - Indicate if certain parts require more elaboration

4. Define Custom Notation or Conventions:
   - Establish any specific syntax or formatting preferences
   - Explain any domain-specific notations you want to use

5. Provide Context and Problem Description:
   - Clearly state the problem the algorithm aims to solve
   - Include relevant background information or constraints
